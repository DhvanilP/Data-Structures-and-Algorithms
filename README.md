# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Here are a few implementation of data structures and algorithms are implemented using python3.This was done as a part of the lab course during the 3rd semester.
## Execution
To execute the program, you need python3 any cpp compiler. Once done the programs can be executed as:
```bash
python3 prog_name.py
```
```bash
g++ prog_name.cpp
```
