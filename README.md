# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Here are a few implementations of data structures and algorithms that are implemented using python3 and cpp.This was done as a part of the lab course.
## Execution
To execute the programs, you need python3 interpreter and cpp compiler. Once done, the programs can be executed as follows:
```bash
python3 prog_name.py
```
```bash
g++ prog_name.cpp
```
